Reason behind this:
I love playing/modding Skyrim (Classic Edition - 32 bit) and I have a SSD that's only 128GB. Said SSD is currently almost full 
and I wanted to know what the top mods eating up my storage space were. Windows 10 doesn't know how to show me the size of the
directories (I could be smooth brained tho) so I wrote up this script that'll show me all of my mods and their sizes, it'll also
sorth the list mods/directories and show me which ones are the largest.
